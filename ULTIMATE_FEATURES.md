## 🌟 Feature 7: Aura Life OS

**Location**: `/opt/aurora/aura/life_os.py`

### The Vision
Imagine having **J.A.R.V.I.S. from Iron Man** managing your entire life:
- Knows your schedule, goals, health, finances
- Anticipates your needs before you ask
- Connects the dots across all life domains
- Proactively helps you succeed

### The Four Pillars

#### 1. 🔗 Unified Ingestion
**Single source of truth for your life**

Connects to:
- **Calendars**: Google, Outlook, Apple
- **Email**: Gmail, Outlook, Proton
- **Messaging**: Slack, Teams, Discord
- **Health**: Apple Health, Oura Ring, Whoop, Garmin
- **Finance**: Bank accounts (via Plaid - bank-level security)
- **Tasks**: Todoist, Asana, Notion
- **Files**: Google Drive, Dropbox

Result: AI knows EVERYTHING about your life in one place.

#### 2. 🧠 Proactive Intelligence
**AI anticipates your needs**

Example 1: Task Detection
```
📧 Email detected: "Need Q3 report by Friday"
→ AI blocks 90min deep work tomorrow morning (your peak time)
→ Creates task with deadline
→ Reminds you Wednesday to review
```

Example 2: Wellness Prediction
```
💤 Your HRV (Heart Rate Variability) is low today
→ AI suggests 5-min breathing exercise before 2pm meeting
→ Blocks recovery time in schedule
→ Adjusts workout intensity for today
```

Example 3: Relationship Management
```
👥 You haven't contacted Alex (your mentor) in 2 months
→ AI found an article he'd love
→ Drafts reconnection email
→ Schedules coffee chat
```

#### 3. 🎯 Goal Decomposition
**Turns dreams into plans**

Example: "I want to run a marathon in 6 months"

AI creates:
- 24-week training plan (72 runs scheduled)
- Tasks: Buy shoes, register for race, nutrition plan
- Monitors: Sleep quality, recovery metrics, injury prevention
- Adjusts: Based on your actual performance

The goal becomes **automatic** - you just follow the daily guidance.

#### 4. 🔄 Holistic Wellness
**Connects the dots**

AI discovers patterns:
```
📊 90-Day Analysis:

🔍 Pattern Detected:
When you sleep < 6.5 hours:
  • Task completion drops 22%
  • Meeting focus decreases 31%
  • Stress levels increase
  • Exercise suffers next day

💡 Recommendation:
Getting an extra 30 minutes of sleep is the 
highest-leverage improvement you can make.

✅ Action Taken:
Adjusted evening routine to prioritize sleep.
Moved non-urgent meetings later in day.
Set gentle alarm for wind-down time.
```
